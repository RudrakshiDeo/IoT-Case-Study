# IoT-Case-Study

# 1. Smart Home Automation
This Python script reads temperature and humidity data from a sensor, checks against a threshold, stores the data in a database, and sends alerts when the threshold is exceeded, potentially using MQTT.

# 2. Smart Agriculture
This Python script is designed to automate irrigation management using a soil moisture sensor, a machine learning model, and a mobile notification system. The script continuously reads data from a soil moisture sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi, processes the data using a pre-trained machine learning model to predict whether irrigation is needed, and then sends a notification to the user's mobile app if irrigation is necessary.

# 3. Smart City
This Python script simulates a traffic monitoring system where multiple sensors send traffic data to a server, which processes the information and adjusts traffic light commands accordingly. It prioritizes green lights when traffic is heavy and reduces green light duration when traffic is light, which can help alleviate congestion and ensure smoother traffic flow through intersections.
